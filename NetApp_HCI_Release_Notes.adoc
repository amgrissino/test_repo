Chapter 1. Introduction
-----------------------

These release notes describe NetApp HCI 1.3. This document provides
information about enhancements, resolved and known issues, and changes
in this release.

NetApp HCI provides both storage and compute resources, combining them
to build a VMware vSphere environment backed by the capabilities of
NetApp SolidFire Element OS. The solution combines storage and compute
hardware in a single chassis. For an overview of the components of
NetApp HCI, see the NetApp HCI Deployment Guide.

You can quickly deploy and configure your fully racked and powered
NetApp HCI system using the NetApp Deployment Engine web interface.

[[GUID-2B8C01A1-F3E4-402D-9697-4CD20E2753EA_d66.html]]

Chapter 2. What's new in this release
-------------------------------------

NetApp HCI 1.3 brings fixes as well as the following new functionality:

[[GUID-2B8C01A1-F3E4-402D-9697-4CD20E2753EA_d66.html#GUID-2B8C01A1-F3E4-402D-9697-4CD20E2753EA__SECTION_76B9820E93E640CE90E05549CF0130AF]]
Data at Rest Encryption for NetApp HCI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NetApp HCI now supports Data at Rest Encryption for the H-Series
platform with self-encrypting SSD drives. Data at Rest Encryption can be
enabled at the storage cluster level in the vSphere Web Client or
Element OS UI. When enabled, all virtual machine datastores and other
volumes on the storage cluster are encrypted.

[[GUID-2B8C01A1-F3E4-402D-9697-4CD20E2753EA_d66.html#GUID-2B8C01A1-F3E4-402D-9697-4CD20E2753EA__SECTION_5D1C22E9B0704581A54E3D3ED186CF93]]
Auto-discovery of NetApp HCI nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you install new NetApp HCI nodes, the nodes automatically configure
IPv4 addresses and are discoverable for deployment on the storage
network without the need for manual IPv4 address configuration or DHCP.
For new NetApp HCI deployments, only one storage node requires an IPv4
address (assigned statically or with DHCP) to access the NetApp
Deployment Engine. See Deploying NetApp HCI 1.3 in the
http://docs.netapp.com/hci/index.jsp[NetApp HCI Documentation Center]
for more information.

[[GUID-2B8C01A1-F3E4-402D-9697-4CD20E2753EA_d66.html#GUID-2B8C01A1-F3E4-402D-9697-4CD20E2753EA__SECTION_EBAEE821E4784E24868BD6D7666CA342]]
Expansion of existing NetApp HCI installations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To scale your compute and storage pools, you can now expand an existing
NetApp HCI installation by adding compute or storage nodes. You can
install the new nodes with a familiar user interface. See Deploying
NetApp HCI 1.3 in the http://docs.netapp.com/hci/index.jsp[NetApp HCI
Documentation Center] for more information.

Joining existing vSphere environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you join an existing vSphere environment, you need to manually
install and configure certain software either before you start
deployment or after deployment is complete. This software is
automatically installed and configured when you chose to install a new
vSphere environment during deployment.

NetApp HCI can be connected to an existing vSphere environment; the
supported vCenter versions are outlined in the preceding section. When
you join an existing vSphere environment, you need to manually install
the following software either before or after deployment:

* [[GUID-F89B29FD-1E92-4B8C-904A-B02E92470F0C_d70.html#GUID-F89B29FD-1E92-4B8C-904A-B02E92470F0C__LI_E9A20B9EB38643E2BF96956EBC49ADCA]]NetApp

HCI management node

If you choose to join an existing vCenter environment, NetApp HCI
installs the appropriate version of VMware ESXi on the compute nodes.

[[GUID-F89B29FD-1E92-4B8C-904A-B02E92470F0C_d70.html#GUID-F89B29FD-1E92-4B8C-904A-B02E92470F0C__SECTION_652C5582D1F24ECEBB63346D57CC5225]]
Keeping VMware software up to date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After deploying NetApp HCI, you should use VMware vSphere Update Manager
to apply the latest security patches for vSphere. Use the
https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix
Tool] to ensure that all versions of software are compatible.

See the VMware vSphere Update Manager
https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/vum_pubs.html[documentation] for
more information.

Chapter 7. Upgrading from previous versions of NetApp HCI
---------------------------------------------------------

For new deployments of NetApp HCI, you should apply the version 1.3
software images from the NetApp Support Site before deployment. You can
keep your system up to date after deployment by upgrading individual
NetApp HCI software components to the versions shipped with NetApp HCI
1.3.
